Players must master each character's unique moveset and adapt their strategies to overcome different playstyles.

                    Objectives: The goal is simple: be the last one standing. In solo matches, it’s a battle to reduce your opponent’s health to zero, while in team-based modes, working together with allies to defeat the opposing team is the key to victory.

                    Inspiration: Anime Showdown draws inspiration from iconic anime battles and fighting games like Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm and Bleach: Brave Souls.
